## Executive Summary

### 🎯 Objective
Transform cfb_model into a modern, cloud-native project with:
- ✅ Multi-tool AI support (Claude, Gemini, Codex)
- ✅ Cloud-based data storage (no external drive needed)
- ✅ Automated quality gates and health checks
- ✅ Streamlined documentation
- ✅ Legacy code cleanup

### ⏱️ Timeline
**12 days total** - Can be spread across multiple sessions

### 💰 Costs
- Cloud storage: ~$2-5/month (Cloudflare R2 recommended)
- One-time migration: Free

### 🔴 Critical Requirements
- [x] Cloudflare or AWS account for Phase 2
- [x] External drive connected for migration/cutover
- [ ] Git branch: `refactor/template-adoption`

### ⚠️ V2 Modeling Workflow Status

**Status:** PAUSED for infrastructure refactoring

The V2 4-phase experimentation workflow (see `docs/process/experimentation_workflow.md`) is temporarily suspended while we modernize infrastructure. Modeling work will resume after:
- Phase 6 completion (integration validated)
- Cloud storage operational
- AI tooling modernized

**Next modeling milestone:** Post-refactoring baseline validation

---

## Phase Overview

```
Day 0:      Phase 0 - Context Capture (NO DRIVE NEEDED)
Days 1-2:   Phase 1 - Foundation & AI Tooling (NO DRIVE NEEDED)          ✅ COMPLETE
Days 3-5:   Phase 2 - Data Storage Migration (DRIVE REQUIRED)            ✅ COMPLETE
Days 6-7:   Phase 3 - Documentation Consolidation (NO DRIVE NEEDED)     ✅ COMPLETE

---

### Phase 3: Documentation Consolidation (Days 6-7)
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Drive Required:** ❌ No
**Effort:** 2 days

#### Goals
- Verify CLAUDE.md content migration (completed in Phase 1)
- AGENTS.md is now primary entry (~300 lines max)
- CLAUDE.md becomes redirect (like current AGENTS.md pattern)

2. Note any broken links to fix next session

---

### Phase 4: Quality Gates & Automation (Days 8-9)
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Drive Required:** ❌ No
**Effort:** 2 days

#### Goals
- Create health check script
- Set up pre-commit hooks
- Update session log templates
- Add automated validation

#### Key Files to Create/Modify
```
.agent/workflows/health-check.sh (create)
.pre-commit-config.yaml (update)
session_logs/TEMPLATE.md (update from template)
```

#### Checklist
- [x] Create .agent/workflows/health-check.sh (ruff format, ruff lint, pytest) ✅
- [x] Make health-check.sh executable: `chmod +x .agent/workflows/health-check.sh` ✅
- [x] Update .pre-commit-config.yaml (add ruff format + lint) ✅
- [x] Update session_logs/TEMPLATE.md to match Vibe-Coding pattern ✅
- [x] Test: health checks pass (`sh .agent/workflows/health-check.sh`) ✅
- [x] Test: pre-commit hooks work (`pre-commit run --all-files`) ✅

#### Session Handoff
**If ending session mid-phase:**
1. Note which automation scripts are complete
2. Document any pre-commit hook issues

---

### Phase 5: Legacy Deletion (Day 10)
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Drive Required:** ❌ No
**Effort:** 1 day

#### Goals
- Delete `legacy/` directory entirely (189MB, 594 files)
- Delete `scripts/archive/` (8 obsolete files)
- Delete `conf/legacy/` (18 old configs)
- Clean break - no archival (Git history serves as backup)

#### Rationale
User decision: Delete permanently. The legacy/ directory has:
- No active imports (verified via grep)
- MLflow history already in artifacts/mlruns/
- Old model artifacts duplicated elsewhere
- No unique valuable code after exploration

#### Checklist
- [x] Verify no imports from legacy/: `grep -r "from legacy\|import legacy" src/ scripts/` ✅
- [x] Verify no imports from scripts/archive/: `grep -r "scripts\.archive" src/ scripts/` ✅
- [x] Run tests to confirm no dependencies: `uv run pytest -q` (should pass) ✅
- [x] Delete legacy/: `rm -rf legacy/` ✅
- [x] Delete scripts/archive/: `rm -rf scripts/archive/` ✅
- [x] Delete conf/legacy/: `rm -rf conf/legacy/` ✅
- [x] Run tests again: `uv run pytest -q` (should still pass) ✅
- [x] Commit deletion with message: `chore: Remove 189MB legacy/ directory - clean break, git history preserved` ✅
- [x] Document in session log: what was deleted and rationale ✅

#### Session Handoff
**If ending session mid-phase:**
1. Note which directories have been verified/deleted
2. If deletion fails tests, document the failure for investigation

---

### Phase 6: Integration & Validation (Days 11-12)
**Status:** ▶️ Ready  
**Drive Required:** ❌ No  
**Effort:** 2 days

#### Goals
- Run end-to-end pipeline tests
- Validate cloud storage integration
- Test documentation builds
- Final review and cleanup

#### Checklist
- [ ] Run health check script: `sh .agent/workflows/health-check.sh` (all green)
- [ ] Run full test suite: `uv run pytest -v` (47+ tests pass)
- [ ] Build documentation: `mkdocs build --strict` (no errors)
- [ ] Verify AI entry points:
  - [ ] AGENTS.md → loads in <2 min
  - [ ] .agent/CONTEXT.md → provides project-specific knowledge
  - [ ] .codex/QUICKSTART.md → has essential commands
- [ ] Test cloud storage: Read a sample dataset from R2/S3
- [ ] Verify external drive not needed: Disconnect drive, run health checks
- [ ] Create completion session log documenting:
  - What changed (summary of all 6 phases)
  - New file structure
  - How to onboard new AI assistants
  - V2 workflow resumption plan

#### Session Handoff
**If ending session mid-phase:**
1. Document which validation checks have passed
2. Note any remaining issues or test failures

## Data Storage Strategy

### Recommended: Cloudflare R2

**Why R2 over AWS S3:**
- ✅ No egress fees (unlimited downloads)
- ✅ Lower cost ($0.015/GB vs $0.023/GB)
- ✅ S3-compatible API
- ✅ Better for data science workloads

### Bucket Structure
```
s3://cfb-model-data/
├── raw/                    # API responses
│   ├── plays/
│   ├── games/
│   └── teams/
├── processed/              # Aggregated features
│   ├── byplay/
│   ├── drives/
│   ├── team_game/
│   └── team_season/
├── models/                 # Serialized models
├── artifacts/              # MLflow artifacts
└── backups/                # Point-in-time snapshots
```

### Migration Approach: Shadow Mode

**Week 1-2: Dual Write**
```python
# Write to both locations
data.to_parquet(local_path)      # Existing
data.to_parquet(s3_path)         # New
```

**Week 3+: Switch Reads**
```python
# Read from S3 (validated)
data = pd.read_parquet(s3_path)
```

**Week 5+: Cleanup**
- Disconnect external drive
- Keep as emergency backup

### Cost Estimation

| Service | Storage | Egress | Total/Month |
|---------|---------|--------|-------------|
| AWS S3 | $0.023/GB | $0.09/GB | $3-7 |
| Cloudflare R2 | $0.015/GB | Free | $1-2 |

**Estimated data size:** 50-100GB  
**Recommended:** Cloudflare R2 (~$2/month)

---

## Success Criteria

### Must Have (Critical)
- [ ] Can start session by reading `AGENTS.md` only
- [ ] Run `sh .agent/workflows/health-check.sh` → all green
- [ ] Access data without external drive connected
- [ ] All tests pass: `uv run pytest -q`
- [ ] Documentation builds: `mkdocs build --strict`

### Should Have (Important)
- [ ] New AI assistant productive in <30 minutes
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks prevent bad commits
- [ ] Cloud storage has versioning enabled
- [ ] Legacy directory deleted (0MB, down from 189MB)

### Nice to Have (Optional)
- [ ] Automatic session log reminders
- [ ] Slack notifications for validation failures
- [ ] Dashboard for cloud storage metrics

---

## Session Log Template

When working on this refactoring, create session logs in:
```
session_logs/YYYY-MM-DD/NN.md
```

Use this format:
```markdown
# Session: Refactoring Phase X - [Brief Description]

## TL;DR
- **Phase:** X of 6
- **Worked On:** [What was done]
- **Completed:** [What was finished]
- **Blockers:** [Any issues]
- **Next:** [What's next]

## Changes Made
- File 1: [description]
- File 2: [description]

## Testing
- [ ] Health checks pass
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Documentation builds

## Notes for Next Session
[Context to carry forward]
```

---

## Rollback Plan

If anything goes wrong:

1. **Code issues:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git branch -D refactor/template-adoption
   ```

2. **Data issues:**
   - Reconnect external drive
   - Switch `CFB_STORAGE_BACKEND=local`
   - All data still on drive

3. **Cloud issues:**
   - Keep local copies during migration
   - Versioned storage allows rollback
   - External drive as ultimate backup

## Refactoring Decisions Record

**Date:** 2026-02-13
**Decisions Made:**

| Question | Decision | Rationale |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| V2 Workflow Status | Paused for refactoring | Infrastructure must stabilize before modeling work resumes |
| CLAUDE.md Content | Split across AGENTS.md + .codex/ + .agent/ | Maintains detail, follows Vibe-Coding patterns |
| Legacy Directory | Delete permanently (no archive) | Clean break, git history preserves if needed |
| Timeline | Spread across multiple sessions | Realistic for available time, needs context handoffs |
