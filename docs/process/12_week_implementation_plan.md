## Success Criteria

By Feb 27, 2026:

1. ✅ **Ridge Baseline** trained and benchmarked
2. ✅ **Data Quality** system operational
3. ✅ **Feature Engineering** Phase 2 complete (1+ feature set tested)
4. ✅ **Model Selection** Phase 3 complete (Champion selected)
5. ✅ **Monitoring Dashboard** operational
6. ✅ **Documentation** 100% aligned with V2
7. ✅ **No Legacy Code** in production path

**Acceptance Test**: Can you run the entire workflow (data → train → predict → score → monitor) using only V2 code and process?

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Data generation failures

**Mitigation**: Test on 1 year first, then scale to all years

### Risk: No features/models pass promotion gates

**Mitigation**: Ridge baseline remains Champion (acceptable outcome)

### Risk: Timeline slippage

**Mitigation**: Prioritize Phase 1-2 over Phase 3-4; adjust timeline as needed

### Risk: Unexpected data quality issues

**Mitigation**: Week 3-4 buffer for fixing issues before experiments

---

## Checkpoints

**End of Week 2**: Baseline established → Continue or reassess?  
**End of Week 6**: Phase 2 complete → Champion features identified?  
**End of Week 10**: Phase 3 complete → Champion model selected?  
**End of Week 12**: V2 operational → Ready for production?
