# CKsPicks-CFB

College-football spread and total prediction system: Python pipeline, immutable
Cloudflare R2 data lake, Neon serving state, and a Vercel web app.

## 2026 posture

The live production champion is the V4 ten-route model bundle
`week0-2026-v4-strict-20260818-r2`. It remains the stable, fail-closed
production and rollback system for the 2026 season.

New research follows the approved data-first football forecasting architecture:

```text
audited football data → validated measurements → opponent adjustment
→ offense/defense team state + uncertainty → spread/total forecast
→ prospective evaluation → timestamped line comparison
```

The program uses 2015–2019 and 2021–2025 as development evidence and excludes
2020. It starts by preserving and clarifying repository architecture, auditing
and repairing data, then testing measurements and deliberately simple ratings
and forecasts. V4 remains isolated from research, Neon activation, and public
publication. Future frozen forecasts provide independent evidence. Market lines
are comparison evidence only; betting decisions are deferred.

## Local setup

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
uv run pytest -q
uv run mkdocs build --strict
```

Production data uses `CFB_STORAGE_BACKEND=r2` and immutable R2 lineage. The
local backend requires `CFB_STORAGE_BACKEND=local` and an external
`CFB_MODEL_DATA_ROOT`; never create or use repository-local `./data/`.

The web app is isolated in `web/`; see [its README](web/README.md) for local
development and publication boundaries.
