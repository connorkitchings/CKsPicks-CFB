College-football spread and total prediction system: Python pipeline, immutable
Cloudflare R2 data lake, Neon serving state, and a Vercel web app.

## V5 checkpoint (2026-09-22)

[V5 model development is complete and accepted](docs/modeling/v5_status.md). Its historical measurement, rating, forecast, and verification lineage is certified. V4 remains the live site model. The first current-state V5 forecast awaits stabilized Week 4 finals and refreshed verified 07/08 parents. A verified forecast, Preview serving rehearsal, and rollback proof will support a separate site activation decision. Prospective outcome tracking continues after launch without a six-slate prelaunch wait. V5 ratings successor is distinct from the V4 feature schema v5 diagnostic.

## 2026 posture

The live production champion is the V4 ten-route model bundle
`week0-2026-v4-strict-20260818-r2`. It remains the stable, fail-closed
production and rollback system for the 2026 season.

New research follows the approved data-first football forecasting architecture:

```text
audited football data → validated measurements → opponent adjustment
→ offense/defense team state + uncertainty → spread/total forecast
→ prospective evaluation → timestamped line comparison
```

The program uses 2015–2019 and 2021–2025 as development evidence and excludes
2020. It starts by preserving and clarifying repository architecture, auditing
and repairing data, then testing measurements, preseason priors, team ratings
and rating-based forecasts. Research cannot alter V4 bundles, Neon activation,
or public publication. Future frozen forecasts provide independent evidence. Market lines
are comparison evidence only; betting decisions are deferred.

## Local setup

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
uv run pytest -q
uv run mkdocs build --strict
```

Production data uses `CFB_STORAGE_BACKEND=r2` and immutable R2 lineage. The
local backend requires `CFB_STORAGE_BACKEND=local` and an external
`CFB_MODEL_DATA_ROOT`; never create or use repository-local `./data/`.

The web app is isolated in `web/`; see [its README](web/README.md) for local
development and publication boundaries.
