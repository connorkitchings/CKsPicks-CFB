# CKsPicks-CFB

College-football spread and total prediction system: Python pipeline, immutable
Cloudflare R2 data lake, Neon serving state, and a Vercel web app.

## 2026 posture

The live production champion is the V4 ten-route model bundle
`week0-2026-v4-strict-20260818-r2`. It remains the stable, fail-closed
production and rollback system for the 2026 season.

The approved successor is a rating-centric hybrid architecture:

```text
football measurements → measurement-level opponent adjustment
→ offense/defense/overall team state + uncertainty
→ structured game prediction → optional ML residual → probabilistic output
→ timestamped market decision
```

Initial requirements are due before Week 0. The successor stays isolated from
V4, Neon activation, and public publication until it has six frozen,
normal-coverage 2026 shadow slates and passes a separate promotion contract.

## Local setup

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
uv run pytest -q
uv run mkdocs build --strict
```

Production data uses `CFB_STORAGE_BACKEND=r2` and immutable R2 lineage. The
local backend requires `CFB_STORAGE_BACKEND=local` and an external
`CFB_MODEL_DATA_ROOT`; never create or use repository-local `./data/`.

The web app is isolated in `web/`; see [its README](web/README.md) for local
development and publication boundaries.
